# Camera binding java
Canon EOS SDK binding in java

# Bindings generation
Bindings are generated via maven plugin jnaerator and execute
    
    jnaerator:generate
Bindings are manually modified and some methods removed (deprecated).
Reason behind is class names are wrong for structures and a generated overloaded method is wrongly typed which fails compilation.

# Technology used for bindings
JNA has been chosen over BridJ as headers (*.h) are in C and to keep same technology with previous project.

Execution time between JNA and BridJ should not affect camera communications.

# JNA config
Mode 'Directory' is used but 'Maven' or 'AutoGeneratedMaven' output same result.

# JNA error
If get:

    org.anarres.cpp.InternalException: Bad token [Invalid65279@1,0]:"TOK65279"
Can solve with:

    grep -rl $'\xEF\xBB\xBF' . | xargs perl -i -pe 's{\xEF\xBB\xBF}{}'
Headers file from Canon SDK have some bad encoding characters.
