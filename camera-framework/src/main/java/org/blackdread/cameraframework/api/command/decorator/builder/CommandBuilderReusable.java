/**
 * <p>Allow to decorate commands with builder. Easier and less verbose than chaining instance of decorators</p>
 * <p>This builder is reusable meaning that decorators are applied for each command passed {@link #setCanonCommand(CanonCommand)} and build only when {@link #build()} is called.
 * <br>
 * Useful when want to apply always same decorators and values.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * NOTE: Not thread-safe !
 *
 * @param <T> type of builder which allow to extends without overloading everything
 * @param <R> type of command return value, can use Object to match any type but careful if later need to cast and type is wrong (This generic type could be removed)
