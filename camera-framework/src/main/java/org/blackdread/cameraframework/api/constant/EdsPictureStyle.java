/**
 * PictureStyle
 * <br>
 * Indicates the picture style.
 * <br>
 * This property is valid only for models supporting picture styles.
 * <br>
 * To get or set the picture style registered in "User Setting," designate user setting 1– (kEdsPictureStyle_User1– ) in
 * inParam. By using inParam = 0, you can designate the current picture style.
 * <br>
 * <br>
 * Note: Write is available as the access type with EdsImageRef only for RAW images.

 * <ul>
 * <li>Computer settings (1 and so on) refers to data that was set by designating a picture style file to upload to the camera from a host computer. Computer setting data is registered in the corresponding user setting. (For example, computer setting 1 corresponds to user setting 1). As a user setting, it represents a picture style that users can select</li>
 * <li>Picture styles registered in computer settings always have a base picture style. As for picture styles other than presets, only base picture styles can be retrieved by means of this property value</li>
 * <li>With this property, it is possible to get values at the time of shooting</li>
