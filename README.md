# canon-sdk-java
Canon EOS SDK in java (EDSDK)

# Project motives
Project intend to give access to Canon EOS Digital Software Development Kit EDSDK in Java.

It starts from scratch due to [Older project](https://github.com/kritzikratzi/edsdk4j) that is not maintained (and some design flow not really good).

Features are:
- Take and download pictures
- Set parameters like Aperture, ISO Speed, etc
- Use live view
- Control multiple cameras

Support for MAC OSX is not intended for now, but only few changes in implementation should be required to make it work.

As stated by EDSDK, 64 bit version is given as is but might not work properly. In any case, prefer to use 32 bit version by running on a java of x86.
